This R package/Shiny app is a handy interface to `ggplot2`/`table1`. It enables you to quickly explore your data to detect trends on the fly. You can do scatter plots, dotplots, boxplots, barplots, histograms, densities and summary statistics tables.
For a quick overview using an older version of the app head to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rBBmJUIZhs" target="_blank"> Youtube Tutorial </a>.
This intro will walk you through making a plot and a summary table.

```
# Install from CRAN:
install.packages("ggquickeda")
library(ggquickeda)
run_ggquickeda()
```
After launching the app with `run_ggquickeda()` and clicking on use sample_data:
The app will load the built-in example dataset and map the first column to y variable(s) and the second column to x variable and a simple scatter plot with points will be generated:

![select sample_df.csv](./intro_1.png){width=100%}

We want to look at the Column Conc (concentration of drug in blood) versus Time joining each Subject data with a line:

* Change the mapped y variable(s) from ID to Conc
(remove the default selection of ID by clicking on the small x and then select Conc)
* Switch to the **Points, Lines** tab and select Lines
(you can also choose another symbol for points and play with point sizes and transparency)

![select sample_df.csv](./intro_2.png){width=100%}

Wait something is wrong! We forgot to tell the app that we want to group by ID.

* Go Back to **Color/Group/Split/Size/Fill Mappings** tab and select ID for the Group By:

![select sample_df.csv](./intro_3.png){width=100%}

While we are on this tab let us map Color By:, Column Split:, Linetype By: and Shape By: to Gender

![select sample_df.csv](./intro_4.png){width=100%}

Now we want to add a loess trend line:
* Go to  **Smooth/Linear/Logistic Regressions** and click on the Smooth radio button:

![select sample_df.csv](./intro_5.png){width=100%}
After we made the plot we wanted, now we are interested to do a summary statistics of Weight and Age columns by Gender this will require the following steps:
* Change the mapped y variable(s) to Weight, Age and Race
* Change the mapped x variable to Gender
* Go to **One Row by ID(s)** and select ID so we keep one row by ID  
* Go to **Descriptive Stats** tab
(notice how you can use html codes for line breaks, superscript and subscript in the Quick HTML Labels. e.g. Weight<sup>(kg)</sup>)

![select sample_df.csv](./intro_6.png){width=100%}

Now launch the application on your own data that is already in R and start exploring it:
**`run_ggquickeda(yourdataname)`**

Alternatively launch the application without any data and navigate to your csv file: 
**`run_ggquickeda()`**
